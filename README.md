##  LeetCode Java Solutions
Welcome to my GitHub repository containing solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in Java.

These solutions are snippets that have passed all test cases on the LeetCode online judge. However, please note that these snippets won't execute directly in your local IDE or compiler. You would need to write a main() function and invoke the solution's function with appropriate inputs or test cases to run them standalone.

## Notes:
The code in this repository is original content written by me. If you find it helpful, consider giving the repository a star ‚≠ê.

## How to Contribute?
Fork the repository.

Make desired changes (add/delete/modify).

Submit a pull request.

## When to Contribute?
You should consider contributing if:

Your solution's time complexity is better than the existing solution.

Your solution's space complexity is better than the existing solution.

Your solution is of the same time and space complexity but more concise. In this case, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.

Your solution is of the same time and space complexity but easier/more readable to understand.

You use the same solution as present in the main branch but have added short comments explaining the rationale at particular code lines, where necessary.

Let's collaborate and enhance our problem-solving skills together!
